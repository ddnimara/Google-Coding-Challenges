# Google-Coding-Challenges
My own solutions to a set of Google Coding Challenges. Additional information (e.g. official name of challenges) can be found [here](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f). I have avoided using its official name in the title of this repository, to make it less google-able, as this set of problems can be used for recruiting.

## Short discription of problems
These problems range different fields, from Markov Models to Algebraic Group Theory and vary in difficulty (as subjective as this may be). All problems here were originally split into levels (from level 1 to level 5), with each level 'increasing' in difficulty. I chose to showcase some of my submitted solutions (all accepted), specifically to problems I found more interesting, challenging and fun. Each problem comes with its own subfolder containing the submitted python code + a short description.

Key concepts found in these problems:
* Sorting custom data types (Sorting Google)
* Dynamic Programming (staircase problem)
* Graph Search Algorithms, such as Bellman Ford (Bunny Problem).
* Markovian Processes (Markov Terminal Points)
* Algebraic Group Theory, more specifically Burnside's Lemma (algebra Systems)

As a final note, some of my code might be a bit 'overcommented', compared to what is considered "industry standard". I did so willingly, as I felt that the added verboseness is more beneficial for both me and the reader (especially in the more complicated problems), since I more easily reflect my way of thought and rationale behind my approach.
